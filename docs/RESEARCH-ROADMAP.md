# Research Roadmap

This roadmap defines a sequence of questions, not a fixed product plan. Each phase must earn the next with evidence.

## Phase 0 — Foundation and measurement design

**Goal:** establish the research discipline before performance code exists.

Deliverables:

- vision and principles;
- conceptual architecture;
- hypothesis and experiment lifecycle;
- benchmark methodology;
- baseline definitions;
- project continuity process;
- first experiment specification.
- Experiment 0 semantics, workload, baseline, fault-model, environment, raw-result, and interpretation prerequisites.

Exit criteria:

- `EXP-0000` is complete;
- `EXP-0001` has a reproducible benchmark plan and correctness criteria;
- baseline systems/primitives are identified;
- target test environments can be recorded consistently.

Phase 0 exited when EXP-0000 and these documentation criteria were completed. This is a readiness exit, not implementation or experimental evidence.

## Phase 1 — Canonical event ingestion

**Current substate:** planning/readiness. EXP-0001 remains proposed and non-executable. Slices A, B/B0, A2, raw D1 append/replay, and the complete R20 reference-context correctness gate are merged and closed as bounded implementation/correctness-validation evidence; they supply no benchmark, durability, or performance evidence. R29 closes the single R28-authorized integration of the existing literal SOP2, mapper, RF1, D1 append, and physical replay components as bounded deterministic correctness evidence. [R12](experiments/EXP-0001/R12-DETERMINISTIC-GENERATOR-SPECIFICATION-AND-VECTORS.md) resolves BLK-006/007 as documentation design only. R16 resolves BLK-009 as documentation design; R18 subsequently authorizes only bounded raw D1 append/replay correctness. External-dependency-free generator and manifest conformance implementation exists with reviewed workspace path dependencies, but generated workload and benchmark execution remain blocked; descriptive and confirmatory execution, BLK-015, executable harness/capture, empirical equivalence, and durability claims remain blocked.

**Primary question:** what is the cost envelope of immutable event creation, sequencing, append, and different durability boundaries?

Candidate comparisons:

- memory-only append;
- buffered append;
- batched append;
- explicit sync per event;
- group commit;
- memory-mapped append where appropriate;
- alternative record encodings;
- checksummed versus non-checksummed records.

Measure:

- events/second;
- bytes/second;
- p50/p90/p95/p99/p99.9 latency;
- CPU time;
- allocations;
- memory footprint;
- storage bandwidth;
- write amplification where measurable;
- crash/recovery correctness.

Exit criteria should not simply be "fast." The experiment must identify which durability semantics and batching strategies produce useful trade spaces.

## Phase 2 — In-memory materialized state

**Primary question:** can canonical events feed an in-memory execution representation with competitive read/write behavior and acceptable replay cost?

Investigate separately:

- key/value baseline state;
- row-like state;
- column-like active state;
- indexing strategies;
- concurrency/sharding models;
- copy-on-write versus in-place updates;
- memory allocation strategies.

Critical measures:

- point-read latency;
- range/scan behavior;
- update latency;
- mixed read/write workloads;
- memory consumed per logical record;
- replay events/second;
- time-to-ready after restart.

## Phase 3 — Recovery and checkpointing

**Primary question:** how should the engine bound replay time without allowing checkpoints to become hidden canonical ownership?

Investigate:

- periodic snapshots;
- incremental checkpoints;
- checkpoint consistency;
- concurrent checkpointing overhead;
- verification against event history;
- recovery from torn/truncated records;
- checkpoint corruption behavior.

## Phase 4 — Secondary materializations

**Primary question:** can one canonical history efficiently support distinct physical representations without unacceptable write amplification or freshness lag?

Start with one materialization at a time.

Candidate sequence:

1. row-oriented persistent projection;
2. columnar analytic projection;
3. secondary index projection;
4. vector projection;
5. graph projection.

Each representation receives its own experiment and workload-specific baseline.

## Phase 5 — Query and access semantics

Only after execution and materialization performance are understood should the project select external access models.

Research topics:

- direct typed API;
- relational/query algebra;
- SQL compatibility or subset;
- document access;
- graph traversal;
- vector similarity;
- cross-materialization planning;
- optimizer behavior.

The important research question is whether the engine can select or combine representations without exposing physical ownership to applications.

## Phase 6 — Embedded engine hardening

Potential focus:

- stable APIs;
- versioned formats;
- fuzz/property testing;
- fault injection;
- observability;
- backup/restore;
- schema evolution;
- compatibility guarantees.

## Phase 7 — Server adapter

Only after the embedded core is sufficiently characterized:

- network protocol;
- sessions;
- authentication/authorization;
- connection management;
- remote transactions;
- admission control;
- client libraries;
- server-level benchmarks separated from core benchmarks.

## Phase 8 — Distributed research, if justified

Potential later topics:

- replication;
- partitioning;
- consensus;
- deterministic distributed logs;
- cross-node materialization;
- failure-domain durability.

This phase is explicitly non-committed. The project should not assume distribution is necessary until use cases and evidence justify the complexity.

### Slice A2 conformance checkpoint

R18 closes R17's external-dependency-free executable conformance, which contains reviewed workspace path dependencies, after preserving PR #64 as historical implementation authority and completing corrective PR #68 exact-head review and CI, for the frozen R12/R14/R16 contracts as
bounded correctness evidence. It is not workload execution or benchmark, persistence, durability,
or performance evidence. R17 itself did not advance Slice C/B1 or authorize a subsequent increment;
R18 supplies the separate authorization below.

### R18 Slice C/B1 readiness checkpoint

R18 closes A2 as bounded correctness evidence and prospectively authorizes only one experiment-local,
external-dependency-free raw D1 append plus reopen/replay correctness crate with exactly one reviewed workspace path dependency on `exp1-record-format`. The tranche validates R1/R5
framing, integrity, accepted physical prefixes, terminal truncation, and fail-closed scanning; it
never labels D1 bytes canonical. BLK-015, D2/D3, execution, benchmarks, physical faults, adapters,
production promotion, and every later tranche remain gated.


## R19 Phase 1 checkpoint

[R19](experiments/EXP-0001/R19-SLICE-C-B1-CLOSURE-AND-DESCRIPTIVE-D1-HARNESS-READINESS.md) closes
the merged raw D1 append/physical replay tranche only as bounded correctness evidence. The smallest
useful generated-workload descriptive D1 harness is not implementation-ready: the exact R7 Linux
semantic-operation-to-physical-record mapping and direct Linux capture implementation were not selected when R19 was decided within the external-dependency-free workspace, which contains reviewed path dependencies and forbids unsafe code. R20 now resolves the mapping as documentation design; the capture-interface/dependency-or-bounded-unsafe decision remains the next gate; caller/authority identity assignment is selected. Phase 1 execution, performance evidence, D2/D3,
faults, adapters, production, and later work remain unauthorized.

### R20 Phase 1 semantic mapping checkpoint

R20 resolves R19's semantic-to-physical ambiguity as documentation design by mapping one validated SOP1 to one structural RF1 type-3 provisional record. It prospectively authorizes only a pure public mapper module in `exp1-raw-append-replay`, depending directly on `exp1-record-format` and `exp1-workload-conformance`; append integration and changes to the other crates remain excluded. The separate live Linux capture decision remains open, and no descriptive execution or evidence is authorized.

### R21 Phase 1 reference-context checkpoint

R21 freezes the bounded reference-catalog/accepted-prefix split and locally decidable R12 outcomes without regenerating semantics. R22 classifies cross-segment targets, and R23 now freezes a canonical manifest-bound proof of complete cell scope. R25 subsequently records that the unchanged v1 bootstrap-to-reference premise is contradictory and supersedes R24 for implementation authorization only; the complete R20 gate remains open. Live Linux capture, the descriptive D1 harness, execution, and every later research phase remain gated.

### R22 Phase 1 cross-segment checkpoint

R22 freezes strictly segment-local reference eligibility and the experiment-local
`E-REFERENCE-CROSS-SEGMENT` disposition without changing R12/R14 bytes or ordering. This fully closes
only the cross-segment governance question. Proof of a complete closed stream scope, R21
implementation, the complete R20 gate, live Linux capture, a descriptive D1 harness, execution, and
later phases remain gated.


### R23 Phase 1 closed-scope checkpoint

R23 freezes the minimum deterministic closure proof: an immutable JCS descriptor names one reviewed
cell, canonically enumerates every namespace with exact R16 manifest and R14 stream/artifact
bindings, and commits to the bytes with a domain-separated digest. Exact equality with supplied
validated streams is required. This closes governance only; reference-context implementation,
live capture, harness construction, execution, and later phases remain separately gated.

### R24 Phase 1 implementation-authorization checkpoint (superseded)

R24 prospectively authorizes the smallest pure reference-context extension in the existing mapper.
Only the frozen mapper/context source and test paths may change; manifests, lockfile, authority crates,
dependencies, append/reopen, capture, and execution remain unchanged or excluded. R25 supersedes this implementation authorization only after its required v1 bootstrap-to-reference gate proved impossible. R24 remains an incomplete historical record; R26 now supplies the separate v2 conformance/validator authorization, not a reference-context implementation.


### R25 Phase 1 bootstrap causal-reference correction

R25 preserves the failed R24/closed-PR-#91 history and every R12/R14/R16 v1 byte while freezing a
prospective v2 uniform causal profile: ordinal 0 bootstraps independently with zero targets in each
segment, and later operations require positive ordered prior same-stream, same-segment ordinary
EventIds. A v2 manifest must encode separate bootstrap and subsequent cardinality for warm-up and
measured segments rather than one scalar. R25 supersedes R24 implementation authorization only and
authorizes no code. R26 now supplies the first, v2 conformance/validator-and-vector authorization;
a new bounded reference-context implementation still requires a later separate authorization. The complete R20
gate and every capture, harness, execution, durability, recovery, and benchmark gate remain open.


### R26 Phase 1 v2 conformance checkpoint

R26 completes the documentation freeze requested by R25: all version-sensitive profile identifiers,
canonical binary and JCS encodings, digest domains, per-segment cardinality policy, immutable
bindings, validator precedence, and literal-vector coverage are fixed. It authorizes only a later
side-by-side v2 extension of the existing workload-conformance crate with unchanged dependencies and
R9 validation. Reference-context code, the complete R20 gate, capture, harnesses, execution, and all
later phases remain gated.

## R27 checkpoint: v2 reference-context implementation authorized

R27 closes the merged R26 v2 conformance implementation as bounded correctness evidence and freezes
the minimum versioned R23 scope extension. The authorized pure v2 catalog/accepted-prefix/contextual mapper in
`exp1-raw-append-replay` is merged and R28 closes it and the remaining R20 reference-context
correctness gate as bounded correctness evidence. The independent live Linux capture freeze still
precedes any descriptive D1 harness, and workload/benchmark execution and later roadmap slices
remain unauthorized.


## R28 checkpoint: R27 closure and test-only D1 integration authorized

[R28](experiments/EXP-0001/R28-R27-CLOSURE-AND-END-TO-END-D1-INTEGRATION-AUTHORIZATION.md)
closes PR #98 reviewed head `67715b3efc4732542152ea9d935d92ebdb2ca0d6`, merged as
`f5cde575cbd82bb788b9519c4efc56e4d1186131` after both exact-head workflows succeeded. This closes
only the complete R20 reference-context correctness gate. One follow-on may update only the existing
`reference_context.rs` integration test plus closure documentation to prove all four literal SOP2
operations map to byte-exact RF1 frames, append through `RawAppender`, and physically reopen/replay
without loss or reordering, with transactional pre-append failure and `std`-only cleanup. This is
deterministic correctness testing, not a harness, capture, execution, durability, benchmark, or
performance increment. The live Linux capture freeze and every later roadmap gate remain blocked.

R29 closes the authorized test-only integration at PR #101 reviewed head `b88908cb9cbba39774437e582308bab25a88482b`, merge `2168839a70baebdea1773fc56e7b8aa0dc9a89e4`, with both exact-head workflows successful. It is bounded deterministic integration/correctness evidence only.


## R29 checkpoint: R28 integration closed and capture boundary frozen

[R29](experiments/EXP-0001/R29-R28-INTEGRATION-CLOSURE-AND-LINUX-CAPTURE-DECISION.md) closes the merged PR #101 integration as bounded deterministic correctness evidence and closes R19's semantic-to-physical mapping blocker. It freezes a Fedora 44 Linux/x86_64, external-dependency-free capture/preflight boundary with unsafe operations allowed only in one isolated future module behind typed safe wrappers and fail-closed provenance, permission, availability, counter, and loss reporting.

Exactly one next PR may add the provisional fourth member `exp1-descriptive-d1-harness`, depending one-way only on the three existing crates, and implement that boundary plus deterministic tests. M01 materialization, appending/replay execution, R7 production, capture publication, workload or benchmark execution, durability, faults, machine changes, and performance conclusions remain outside the roadmap authorization.
