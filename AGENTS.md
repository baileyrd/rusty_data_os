# AGENTS.md — Rusty Data OS Working Agreement

This file defines how human contributors and AI coding agents must work in this repository.

## 1. Authority order

Before proposing or implementing work, read these files in order:

1. `/AGENTS.md`
2. `/CHATGPT_WORKFLOW.md`
3. `/docs/PROJECT-STATUS.md`
4. `/docs/VISION.md`
5. `/docs/PRINCIPLES.md`
6. `/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
7. `/docs/RESEARCH-ROADMAP.md`
8. Applicable hypotheses, experiment definitions, benchmark methodology, ADRs, and specifications.

Repository state on `main` is authoritative over chat history or unstaged ideas.

## 2. Research before architecture

Do not promote an architectural idea because it sounds elegant or familiar.

Every significant technical claim should move through:

```text
idea -> hypothesis -> experiment -> evidence -> decision
```

A hypothesis must be falsifiable. An experiment must state its measurement method before implementation. A decision must cite the evidence that justifies it.

## 3. No premature production code

Experimental implementations belong under `/experiments/`.

Reusable production-oriented code belongs under `/crates/` only after the relevant experiment has produced evidence and an ADR or specification has authorized graduation.

Do not add server/networking layers, SQL interfaces, generalized plugin systems, distributed coordination, or unrelated abstractions unless the research roadmap and current experiment require them.

## 4. Benchmark integrity

Performance claims must follow `/docs/benchmarks/METHODOLOGY.md`.

At minimum:

- capture hardware, OS, filesystem, compiler, toolchain, and build configuration;
- distinguish warm-up from measured samples;
- report distributions, not only averages;
- separate throughput from latency;
- identify durability semantics for every write benchmark;
- preserve raw benchmark results when practical;
- compare against explicit baselines;
- avoid changing multiple independent variables in the same experiment unless the design requires it.

## 5. Correctness precedes speed

A faster implementation that violates declared durability, ordering, replay, or recovery semantics is not a successful optimization.

Each experiment must define correctness invariants and tests independently of performance targets.

## 6. Failed experiments are valuable

Do not delete or obscure negative results. Mark the experiment conclusion clearly and preserve enough evidence to explain why an approach was rejected, deferred, or constrained.

## 7. Documentation synchronization

When an experiment changes project knowledge, update all relevant artifacts in the same change:

- experiment result/conclusion;
- associated hypothesis status;
- ADR if a decision is made;
- `PROJECT-STATUS.md`;
- architecture/specification only if the evidence warrants promotion.

## 8. Smallest useful increment

Prefer bounded experiments that isolate one research question. Avoid "build the database" tasks. The smallest experiment that can falsify a hypothesis is preferred.

## 9. Rust implementation expectations

When Rust code begins:

- favor explicit ownership and concurrency semantics;
- make unsafe code exceptional and justified;
- benchmark release builds;
- keep experimental dependencies isolated;
- document platform-specific behavior;
- prefer deterministic replay and testability over hidden background behavior;
- expose durability boundaries explicitly in APIs rather than implying them.

## 10. Current constraint

The project remains planning/readiness-first; no engine architecture is final. Slice A/A1 and Slice
B/B0 are closed only as bounded implementation/correctness-validation evidence. Slice A2 is closed only as bounded conformance/correctness evidence after its corrective gate; R17 implements the frozen R12/R14/R16 contracts only in the external-dependency-free conformance subset, which contains reviewed workspace path dependencies. R19 closes the R18-authorized Slice C/B1 raw D1 append and deterministic reopen/replay implementation only as bounded correctness evidence. The locally decidable R20 semantic-operation-to-physical-record mapping subset is implemented as a pure correctness component in `exp1-raw-append-replay`, with direct path dependencies on the existing record-format and workload-conformance crates and no append integration; this is bounded implementation/correctness-validation evidence only. R21 freezes the locally decidable immutable-catalog/accepted-prefix design, R22 selects strictly segment-local references, and R23 freezes a canonical closed-scope descriptor whose exact manifest-bound membership and domain-separated digest prove the complete stream set for one authorized cell. R23 closes the closed-scope governance blocker. R25 records that closed, unmerged PR #91 falsified R24’s assumption that the unchanged v1 authorities can produce a valid bootstrap-to-reference causal stream; R25 supersedes R24 for implementation authorization only, preserves every R12/R14/R16 v1 vector and byte, and freezes prospective v2 governance without authorizing code. R26 freezes the complete v2 conformance contract; PR #95 reviewed head `35f9a0f245ac488828df4f639263edb3fb50be86`, merged as `f4ed0c310fa46c6de209ea0f776c4749e31cdd34` with exact-head successful CI, implements it side by side with v1 as bounded conformance/correctness evidence. R27 closes that tranche, freezes the minimum v2 extension of R23 closed-scope proof while preserving v1 and prohibiting mixed membership, and authorizes exactly one pure v2 reference-context mapper implementation in the existing `exp1-raw-append-replay` crate. R28 closes that implementation at PR #98 reviewed head `67715b3efc4732542152ea9d935d92ebdb2ca0d6`, merged as `f5cde575cbd82bb788b9519c4efc56e4d1186131` with both exact-head workflows successful, as bounded correctness evidence. The full R20 reference-context correctness gate is closed. R29 closes the R28-authorized test-only literal SOP2-to-physical-reopen D1 correctness path at PR #101 reviewed head `b88908cb9cbba39774437e582308bab25a88482b`, merged as `2168839a70baebdea1773fc56e7b8aa0dc9a89e4` with both exact-head workflows successful, only as bounded deterministic integration/correctness evidence. The R19 semantic-to-physical mapping blocker is closed. R29 froze an external-dependency-free Linux/x86_64 clocks/resource/file/procfs preflight ABI; R30 closes its merged implementation and freezes a counter-read `perf_event_open` ABI for four events. R31 closes that implementation only as bounded deterministic ABI/lifecycle/scaling/cleanup correctness evidence and freezes the first-cell sources and orchestration contract. R32 closes PR #108 only as bounded deterministic injected orchestration/lifecycle/source-metadata/failure/cleanup correctness evidence, resolves the internal live-wrapper interface gap as design, and authorizes exactly one later non-live-tested internal adapter implementation. Live capture, target probing or validation, record production, workload or benchmark execution, confirmatory tracefs, and performance evidence remain blocked or unauthorized. Generated workloads, workload or benchmark execution, D2/D3, `fsync` durability, faults, adapters or baselines outside the narrowly authorized internal capture adapter, production crates, and later increments remain unauthorized. Run the unchanged R9 validation
sequence and `git diff --check` from the repository root.
